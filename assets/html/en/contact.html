	<h1>About us</h1>
	<p>Newly created, Messe Basse Production is a young non-profit organization (French law 1901 organization), founded by Arthur Beaulieu and David Béché. Long time friends and both fond of art under its many forms, we gathered many skills either technical or artistic along the years. Driven by the desire to share our know-how with artists made us created this organization, with the only goal to assist artists to focus on their art, while promoting it and making it standard according to the industry norms.</p>
	<p>Key values of Messe Basse Production, are open sourced and non-profit. We are commited to leave artists the ownership of their art and projects, while helping them produce and express their creativity through their work.</p>
	<p>You want to discuss with us about those values, or maybe you want some help to produce, distribute and promote your music, your podcasts, your movies, your books, your softwares, your collections or any other form of art ? Or maybe you want to join us in this magnificient journey to share your knowledge to artists that trusts us ? Then contact us, we will be happy to answer your request :</p>
